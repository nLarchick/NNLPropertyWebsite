Exercise #8 -----------------
THREE INSPIRATIONAL WEBSITES:
	- https://neatmethod.com/
		* I really appreciate the work to separate from the usual format of website creation. I 		also like the use of empty space. This is for an organizing company and the website conveys 		that properly.
	- https://www.turnerconstruction.com/
		* I like this website for its clear construction-based format - which the website conveys 	well. Additionally it has some 'oddities' that set it apart from other websites, making it nice to 	look at... and portray the organization of a construction company.
	- https://www.thepostcolorado.com/
		* This website is for a restaurant, specifically one with a strong theme. I feel that this 	website does a great job in sticking with the theme and making it evident -> further pushing its 	'brand'
