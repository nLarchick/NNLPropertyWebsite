                <p> There should be no end to the possible content in here, after all its a 
                    whole lot of rambling from you about information that people might want 
                    to hear. This is even a place where you can plug social media like 
                    instagram and snapchat if you really want.</p>

                <p>Use this section to talk about yourself, starting with your history and 
                    schooling. Move on to what you like to do as well as how you spend your time. 
                    Talk about some of your personal values and other important things people 
                    might want to know about you.</p>

                <p>This page should also function as a home page of sorts, adding seperate pages 
                    to further information about things like school, hiring, hobbies, and the 
                    like. There should be more then enough content to produce something similar 
                    to that here!</p>
