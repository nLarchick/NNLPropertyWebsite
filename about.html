                <h3>-- Â¿Who am I? --</h3>
            
                <p>My name is Noah Larchick, as of 2025 I am 22 years of age, finishing my 
                    final semester as a college student. I grew up in Aurora colorado but moved 
                    to Fort Collins for school in the past 4 years. While not at school I have 
                    various hobbies like playing Spikeball and Volleyball with my friends. I 
                    also enjoy the outdoors: I often fish along the Poudre River. When the 
                    weather isn't as good, I prefer to stay inside. I have a few video games 
                    that I enjoy playing; some of which are Elden Ring and Cities Skylines. 
                    Along with school and fun, I also picked up cooking through a kitchen job 
                    which I maintained during my time in Fort Collins. Check out the rest of 
                    the page for more information about me!</p>

                <h3>-- ACADEMIC CAREER --</h3>

                <div class="flexy">
                    <p>My academic career (since I can remember) started at <b>RMSEL</b> or Rocky 
                        Mountain School of Expeditionary Learning. Since then I have attended 
                        <b>Overland High School</b> and <b>Colorado State University</b> up until today. 
                        Schooling has not taken me out of the state but I have moved between 3 
                        cities: <b>Denver</b>, <b>Aurora</b>, and <b>Fort Collins</b>.</p>
